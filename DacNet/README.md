# DACNet: Reproduction and Extension of CheXNet for Chest X-ray Classification

This repository contains:
1. a **reproduction** of the CheXNet DenseNet-121 model on the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset, and  
2. an **extension (DACNet)** designed to improve performance under class imbalance.

It also includes a Vision Transformer baseline and a Streamlit demo for inference.

---

## Reproduction Scope

This work reproduces key components of:

**CheXNet: Radiologist-Level Pneumonia Detection on Chest X-Rays with Deep Learning**  
Rajpurkar et al., 2017 (arXiv:1711.05225)

### What is reproduced
- DenseNet-121 architecture
- Multi-label classification (14 thoracic diseases)
- Patient-level dataset splitting
- Evaluation using AUC-ROC and F1 score

### Known differences from the original work
- No access to the original **expert-labeled test set**
- Labels are based on the publicly available NIH dataset
- Some implementation details are inferred due to lack of official code

## Dataset

This project uses the **NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset**.

- ~112,000 frontal chest X-rays  
- 30,805 patients  
- 14 disease labels  

Download from:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nih-chest-xrays/data

---

## Dataset Setup

Your directory must match what the scripts expect.

Example structure:

```
data/
├── Data_Entry_2017.csv
├── images_001/
├── images_002/
...
├── images_012/
```

If your dataset is stored elsewhere, update the path in the scripts:

```python
CONFIG["data_dir"] = "/path/to/your/data"
```

---

## Reproducible Environment (Docker)

We provide a Docker environment to improve reproducibility.

### Build the container

```bash
docker build -t dacnet-env .
```

### Run the container

```bash
docker run --gpus all -it --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace/DacNet dacnet-env
```

Notes:
- Requires CUDA-compatible GPU  
- ≥8GB VRAM recommended  
- If no GPU, remove `--gpus all`  

---

## Quick Verification

Before running full training, verify the setup:

```bash
bash reproducibility/test_run.sh
```

This checks:
- dataset loading  
- model initialization  
- training loop execution  
If this step fails, verify dataset paths and file structure before proceeding to full training.
---
## Running the Models

Once inside the Docker container, you can execute the training scripts.
 
### 1. Reproduction Baseline (CheXNet)

```bash
python scripts/replicate_chexnet.py
```

### 2. DACNet (Improved CNN)

```bash
python scripts/Dacnet.py
```

### 3. Vision Transformer

```bash
python scripts/vit_transformer.py
```

If you encounter CUDA memory errors, reduce batch size in the scripts.

---
 
Evaluation results (AUC and F1) will print to the console. If WANDB is configured, it will log automatically; otherwise, the container defaults to offline mode. The best model checkpoint will be saved in a `models/<run_id>` folder.
